## Why not develop surf-exel instead of writing a new editor?

Here are the problems I face with surf-exel.

* Doesnt compile nicely using pyinstaller on Ubuntu
* GTTS doesnt work properly
* It doesnt have syntax highlighting
* The code is very.... flimsy.
* I have tried many times on different computers to add features but it just doesnt work.


All in all, I want to make an editor that just works. 
```
This time... I will try my best to code on the editor itself.
```
Thank you!
