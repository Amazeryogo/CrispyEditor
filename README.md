## CrispyEditor

### What is CrispyEditor?
CrispyEditor is another attempt at making an editor using Tkinter.
Unlike the other editors, it is not a full-fledged GUI editor.

#### Features:
* **Easy to use**
* **No dependencies except Tkinter and python3**
* **No need to install anything**
* **No need to learn anything**
* **Has a customised terminal for doing anything using the command line**
* **Has a customised file browser (beta) for finding files**
* **Has Python syntax highlighting** *We are planning to add more syntax highlighting soon*
* **All the settings are stored in a JSON config file**


### How to use CrispyEditor?
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Amazeryogo/CrispyEditor
$ cd CrispyEditor
$ bash run.sh
```

### Problems and Drawbacks
* **Doesnt ship with an executable**
* **You need to manually cd into the directory and run the script**
* **Overall, it is a bit of a mess.**

### Future plans
* **Add more syntax highlighting**
